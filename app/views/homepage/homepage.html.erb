				In Israel, there is a law against smoking in public places but it is not being enforced  properly in bars,
				clubs and other night-life facilities.

			</li>
			<li>
				Customers, employees, entertainers and vendors who spend time in these smoky environments,

				whether voluntary or not, are exposed to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke.
			</li>
			<li>
				We are very aware of the smell that gets in our clothes and our hair,

				but did you know that there are over 7000 chemicals that lead to that smell?
			</li>
			<li>
				Those chemicals cause very real, measurable, expensive and avoidable harm like asthma,

				lung cancer, emphysema, and other chronic diseases.
			</li>
			<li>
				We know that the related costs in both lives and healthcare  are real,

				so why arenâ€™t we doing more to eliminate it?
			</li>
			<li>
				We are offering you to support healthy air quality in all indoors places

				by choosing a smoke free venue from the list above for your next night out.
